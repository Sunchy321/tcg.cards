# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Value in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

This repo uses the local-markdown tracker, so a role is not an issue label: it is the value of the `Status:` line near the top of the ticket file. Apply the values above verbatim.

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding string from this table.

Edit the middle column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.
